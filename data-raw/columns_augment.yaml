.class: The predicted class. Needs custom info. (TODO -- make this a factor?)
.cluster: The cluster assigned by the k-means algorithm
.col.prop: Column proportion (2 dimensions table only)
.conf.high: Upper confidence interval value  `predict.rq` does not provide confidence
  intervals when `newdata` is provided.
.conf.low: Lower confidence interval value.
.cooksd: Cooks distance. See [stats::cooks.distance()] for additional details.
.expected: Expected count under the null hypothesis
.fitted: Fitted / predicted value.
.fitted_j_0: population-level fitted values for the j-th longitudinal process
.fitted_j_1: individuals-level fitted values for the j-th longitudinal process
.hat: Diagonal of the hat matrix. TODO -- add interpretation.
.observed: Observed count
.probability: Posterior probability of predicted class  If the `data` argument is
  given, those columns are included in the output (only rows for which predictions
  could be made). Otherwise, the `y` element of the poLCA object, which contains the
  manifest variables used to fit the model, are used, along with any covariates, if
  present, in `x`.  Note that while the probability of all the classes (not just the
  predicted modal class) can be found in the `posterior` element, these are not included
  in the augmented output.
.prop: Proportion of the total
.remainder: The remainder, or *random* component of the decomposition.
.resid: Residuals of fitted values. TODO -- document when present. Residuals on which
  data set?
.resid_j_0: population-level residuals for the j-th longitudinal process
.resid_j_1: individual-level residuals for the j-th longitudinal process
.residuals: Pearson residual
.row.prop: Row proportion (2 dimensions table only)
.rownames: blergh
.se.fit: Standard errors of fitted values. TODO -- prediction or mean interval?
.seasadj: The seasonally adjusted (or *deseasonalised*) series.
.seasonal: The seasonal component of the decomposition.
.sigma: Estimate of residual standard deviation when corresponding observation is
  dropped from model. Same as LOO-CV estimate?.
.std.resid: Standardised residuals  Some unusual `lm` objects, such as `rlm` from
  MASS, may omit `.cooksd` and `.std.resid`.
.stdres: Standardized residual
.tau: Quantile estimated  Depending on the arguments passed on to `predict.rq` via
  `...`, a confidence interval is also calculated on the fitted values.
.trend: The trend component of the decomposition.
.uncertainty: The uncertainty associated with the classification. If a point has a
  probability of 0.9 of being in its assigned class under the model, then the uncertainty
  is 0.1.
.weight: The final robust weights (`stl` only, if requested).
