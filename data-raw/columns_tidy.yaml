# general notes:
# - use singular rather than plural (i.e. autocorrelation, not autocorrelations)
# - use num_* rather than n_*
# - try to avoid single letter column names in favor of something more informative

estimate2: Sometimes two estimates are computed, such as in a two-sample t-test
event: observed number of events
exp: weighted expected number of events in each group
expected: expected number of events (present only if a `ratetable` term is present)  If

  as there were factors fitted.
