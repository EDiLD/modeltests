- column: .class
  description: The predicted class. Needs custom info. (TODO -- make this a factor?)
- column: .cluster
  description: The cluster assigned by the k-means algorithm
- column: .col.prop
  description: Column proportion (2 dimensions table only)
- column: .conf.high
  description: Upper confidence interval value  `predict.rq` does not provide confidence
    intervals when `newdata` is provided.
- column: .conf.low
  description: Lower confidence interval value.
- column: .cooksd
  description: Cooks distance. See [stats::cooks.distance()] for additional details.
- column: .expected
  description: Expected count under the null hypothesis
- column: .fitted
  description: Fitted / predicted value.
- column: .fitted_j_0
  description: population-level fitted values for the j-th longitudinal process
- column: .fitted_j_1
  description: individuals-level fitted values for the j-th longitudinal process
- column: .hat
  description: Diagonal of the hat matrix. TODO -- add interpretation.
- column: .observed
  description: Observed count
- column: .probability
  description: Posterior probability of predicted class  If the `data` argument is
    given, those columns are included in the output (only rows for which predictions
    could be made). Otherwise, the `y` element of the poLCA object, which contains
    the manifest variables used to fit the model, are used, along with any covariates,
    if present, in `x`.  Note that while the probability of all the classes (not just
    the predicted modal class) can be found in the `posterior` element, these are
    not included in the augmented output.
- column: .prop
  description: Proportion of the total
- column: .resid
  description: Residuals of fitted values. TODO -- document when present. Residuals
    on which data set?
- column: .resid_j_0
  description: population-level residuals for the j-th longitudinal process
- column: .resid_j_1
  description: individual-level residuals for the j-th longitudinal process
- column: .residuals
  description: Pearson residual
- column: .row.prop
  description: Row proportion (2 dimensions table only)
- column: .se.fit
  description: Standard errors of fitted values. TODO -- prediction or mean interval?
- column: .sigma
  description: Estimate of residual standard deviation when corresponding observation
    is dropped from model. Same as LOO-CV estimate?.
- column: .std.resid
  description: Standardised residuals  Some unusual `lm` objects, such as `rlm` from
    MASS, may omit `.cooksd` and `.std.resid`.
- column: .stdres
  description: Standardized residual
- column: .tau
  description: Quantile estimated  Depending on the arguments passed on to `predict.rq`
    via `...`, a confidence interval is also calculated on the fitted values.
- column: .uncertainty
  description: The uncertainty associated with the classification. If a point has
    a probability of 0.9 of being in its assigned class under the model, then the
    uncertainty is 0.1.
- column: .remainder
  description: The remainder, or *random* component of the decomposition.
- column: .seasadj
  description: The seasonally adjusted (or *deseasonalised*) series.
- column: .seasonal
  description: The seasonal component of the decomposition.
- column: .trend
  description: The trend component of the decomposition.
- column: .weight
  description: The final robust weights (`stl` only, if requested).
